### Code from scratch
This repo contains some code I write on my free time. It has two objectives: first, learn new algorithms on ML and numerical analysis; second, close the gap between the conceptual idea of the algorithm and its practical implementation, whether in Python or C++. I am not after efficiency and perfectly optimized code here, I am satisfied if it works well on academic examples. The rest is left to developers. I only code algorithms I did not have the occasion to code in one of my previous project, I do not try to make an exhaustive repo of all ML algorithms either.
