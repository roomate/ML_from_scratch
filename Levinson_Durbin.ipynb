    "To solve this system, one can employs the recursive **Levinson-Durbin algorithm** [1]. See [2] for a proof. It runs in $\\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ time whereas vanilla Gaussian elimination runs in $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$, which is a drastic amelioration. The matrix of the system is said *Toeplitz*, it takes advantage of that. The diagonal has to be non-zero, but any non-null signal will check that condition.\n",

    "Levinson-Durbin algorithm was coined to solve a linear equation. This linear equation, famously known as the *Yule-Walker* equation, is a direct consequence of the autoregressive model and definition of autocorrelation. In Time Series modeling, an autoregressive model of order $p$ (AR(p)) is an ansatz for the dynamic of $(x[n])_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of the form:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "The question lies in the choice of the coefficients $(a_i)_{i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, p\\}}$. One assumes to have access to (at least an estimator of) the autocorrelation up until order $p$. It is classically defined as:\n",
